            <p>Every photographer has a story about how they began their journey into the world of capturing moments. For me, it wasn't a sudden revelation or a childhood dream that slowly manifested into reality. Instead, it was a long-awaited investment into something I had been curious about for some time.</p>

            <p>Growing up in a family of photographers, I was always surrounded by cameras, lenses, and stories of the perfect shot. My father would often record me and my sisters growing up, each recording holding memories of different eras and adventures.</p>

            <h2>The Investment</h2>

            <p>The decision to finally invest in my own photography equipment wasn't taken lightly. As a student at Morehouse College pursuing Computer Science with a minor in Data Science and Analytics, every dollar counts. But there comes a moment when you realize that some investments aren't just about money – they're about investing in yourself and your passions.</p>

            <p>After months of research, reading reviews, and saving up, I finally made the purchase that would change my perspective on the world around me. I told myself that I didn't want to hit a ceiling, that is why I wanted the latest and greatest. No I dont want pre-owned. Although it wasnt an easy purchase to come off of, it was my investment into my passion, and you shouldnt be cheap when investing into things you love. The weight of the camera in my hands for the first time was both exciting and intimidating. This wasn't just a device; it was a tool that would allow me to capture the moments that I always seem to miss.</p>

            <h2>First Steps</h2>

            <p>My first few days with the camera were humbling. Watching youtube guides on how to set up the camera, playing around in the menu settings, making the camera mine. Despite growing up around photographers, I quickly realized that understanding photography and actually doing it are two completely different things. The technical aspects – understanding aperture, shutter speed, ISO – were just the beginning. The real challenge was learning to see the world through a different lens, quite literally.</p>

            <p>I started small, photographing what I saw, what I thought was nice, literally the first photograph on that camera, is me. Each shot was a learning experience, and each mistake taught me something new about both the technical and artistic sides of photography.</p>

            <h2>Finding My Voice</h2>

            <p>What struck me most during those early days was how photography forced me to slow down and really observe my surroundings, not only that, it showed me what to shoot, focal length limitations, and how good auto-mode is. In our fast-paced world, especially as a busy college student, it's easy to rush through life without truly seeing what's around us. I'm starting to notice how photography is going to change that for me.</p>

            <p>I began to notice the difference between an Iphone Camera, with its versatility and great postprocessing, compared to my camera, where Uncompressed raw captures every single detail that it can. I also started to see the intricate patterns in nature that I had previously overlooked. Photography wasn't just about capturing images; it was about training my eye to see beauty in the ordinary.</p>

            <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>

            <p>Looking back at those first few shots of my photography journey, I'm amazed at how much I've grown, not just as a photographer, but as a person, especially in this short amount of time... This hobby – this passion – has taught me patience, persistence, and the importance of perspective. I find myself always researching places to shoot, experimenting with different focal lengths, and overall growing into a more thoughtful and intentional photographer.</p>

            <p>Every photograph I take now is a step forward in this journey. Some shots are successful, others serve as learning experiences, but each one contributes to my growth. The investment I made wasn't just in equipment; although it was expensive, it was moreso an investment in a new way of seeing and experiencing the world.</p>
